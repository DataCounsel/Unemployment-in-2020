# Unemployment in 2020


Unemployment is a very significant marker for a country’s economy. I chose this topic because unemployment creates an undue burden on an individual and their family and ultimately affects the country’s overall economy. Through this project I try to understand what factors plays a crucial role in driving unemployment and if there are nuances which are often not stated but can be found as trends when aggregated over a period. For my project I have decided to find the correlation between the party in power and what the employment rate was like under them.To understand the correlation between the demographics and the unemployment. Also include factors like education and race.

The data has been cleaned, transformed and merged into one data source using Tableau Prep Builder. The data has been categorized into Total workers, men and women 20 years and above and 16-19 both sexes.

My second dashboard shows the unemployment based on gender and age. The pie chart shows the distribution of men and women in the total population and the graph below shows the distribution of men and women in the Unemployed population in the corresponding age groups from 16 years to 64 years.
